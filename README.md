# Svelte Kit Ethers Boilerplate

Provides Svelte Kit skeleton with Typescript, TailwindCSS and ethers provider store with Metamask and WalletConnect connection methods set up.

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte);

## Creating a project

Fork this repo 

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `yarn install` (or `pnpm install` or `npm install`), start a development server:

```bash
yarn dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
yarn build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
